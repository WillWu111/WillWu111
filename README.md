### About Me

I am a BSc student in Information and Computing Science at Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University (XJTLU) in Suzhou.

My research interests lie in **computer vision** and **efficient deep learning**, especially for visual generation. I initially focused on **2D human pose estimation** under the supervision of [Prof. Yong Yue](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HXU7M0kAAAAJ&hl=en), working with Vision Transformer–based models for multi-granularity pose estimation. I am now a research intern at Shanghai Jiao Tong University under [Prof. Songhua Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AnYh2rAAAAAJ&hl=en), where I work on **high-resolution and super-resolution video generation**, covering both training-based and training-free paradigms, with a strong emphasis on **efficiency**.
